### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
---
My name is Jens Lauterbach and I am a _backend_ software engineer with a life long passion for writing code. I have been "at it" for over 20 years and I do not see me stopping any time soon. Professionally, I am spending my days at [Groundfog](https://groundfog.cloud), mainly building serverless applications for our customers. If I can find some time to spare during the evening, I am currently hacking away on a small command line tool called [ddbt](https://github.com/jenslauterbach/ddbt) and analysing [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) performance.
